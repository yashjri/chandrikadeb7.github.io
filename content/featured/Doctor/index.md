This is the Full Stack Doctor Appointment Booking system. I used React JS, MongoDB, Express JS, and Node JS to build my own appointment booking website, so It will be a **MERN Stack project**.

This full-stack appointment booking system can be used by a doctor or a hospital. In this project, I have created **3 levels of authentication**.

1st one is for **Patients** so that patients can log on to the website, book appointments with doctors, and manage the booked appointments.

The 2nd one is the **Doctor Login**, so the doctor can log in and check their appointments and earnings. The doctor can also update their profile from the dashboard.

3rd one is **Admin Dashboard** where the admin can manage the appointment and the admin can also manage the doctor profile.

In this full-stack application, I integrated the online payment gateways so that users can pay the appointment fee online on this website.
