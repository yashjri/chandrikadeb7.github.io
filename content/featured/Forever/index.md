In this project, I learnt to build and deploy an eCommerce website using React JS, MongoDB, Express JS, Node JS. After building this e-Commerce project using **MERN Stack**, I deployed it online on Vercel.

In this E-Commerce website project, user can explore products, filer and short the product and user can add the product in cart by selecting product variant like size. User can also order the product by providing the delivery address and using any Payment method either Cash on Delivery or Online payment. In this Full Stack e commerce project I added 2 online payment gateways that is **Stripe** and **Razorpay**. So that customer can pay online and place the order.

I also built the admin dashboard of this eCommerce website so that admin can upload the project, delete the product or check all products added on the store. I built this eCommerce backend project / Backend API's using Node.js and Express and all products, user and order data will be stored on MongoDB database.

After completing this full stack project's ( Frontend and Backend ) I deployed it on Vercel so that anyone can explore this ecommerce website.
