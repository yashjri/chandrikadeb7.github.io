[Cube Ninja](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.halfbrick.fruitninjafree&gl=US) is a dangerously addictive skill game in which the object is simply to slice up as much cubes as you can. Ninja hates cubes, so the gameâ€™s training content is to slice up those cubes thrown out from the bottom of screen. Cube Ninja is a clone version of **Fruit Ninja** created by me.
