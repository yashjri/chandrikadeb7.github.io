In this project, I created a **Full-Stack AI SaaS Application** Using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. I made a Text to Image generator App that allows everyone to generate images using AI.

I made the **credit system** to generate the image and users can purchase more credits using the online payment gateway that I had integrated with this app.

In this Full Stack AI React project, I have created user authentication using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node JS to create an account and log into an existing one. User account details will be stored in the MongoDB database. I generated the images using **Clipdrop API**.
