Hello , I got introduced to programming in my freshman Year at [Maharishi Arvind Institute of Science & Management,  Jaipur](https://www.maism.org/) where I'm persuing my Bachelors in Computer Applications (2021-2024).
 
I create new websites and individual web pages and also update existing websites with **New content** and continuously enhance **Website functionality**.

I represented my School in **Chess Olympiad Tournament** in 2018.


I have been awarded as Winner of the Inter-College competition of [MAISM](https://www.maism.org/) college in [**Chess**](https://www.chess.com/member/yashjri) competition (2023).

Here is a list of programming Languages that I'm familiar with!!
