I was introduced to programming during my freshman year at the [Maharishi Arvind Institute of Science & Management,  Jaipur](https://www.maism.org/), where I completed my Bachelor in Computer Applications (2021-2024).
 
I design new websites and individual web pages, update old websites with New content, and constantly improve Website functionality.

I represented my school in the Chess Olympiad Tournament in 2018.


I won the Inter-College [Chess](https://lichess.org/@/Yashjri) competition at [MAISM](https://www.maism.org/) college twice (2023-2024).

Also, I have competed in National Chess Tournaments twice, which has sharpened my analytical skills and taught me the importance of preparation and adaptability.



Here is a list of programming Languages that I'm familiar with!!
