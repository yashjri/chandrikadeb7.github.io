Hello , I got introduced to Programming in My Freshman Year at [Maharishi Arvind Institute of Science & Management,  Jaipur](https://www.maism.org/) where I'm Persuing my Bachelors in Computer Applications (2021-2024) with [74.4%] in my First Year.

I'm currently learning [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and I create new Websites and individual Web pages. 

I also update existing Websites with **New content** and continuously enhance **Website functionality**.

Also, I represented my [Central Academy](https://www.centralacademy.ac.in/) School in Chess Olympiad Tournament in 2018.
I have also played for [RUFC](https://rajasthanunitedfc.in/) Football Club in 2019-20.

Here is a List of Programming Languages that I'm familiar with!
